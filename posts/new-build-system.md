The sportdb command line tool includes a new build system (as a new and easier all-in-one option).  To try it - use the new Datafile - a mini language a.k.a. domain-specific language (DSL) that lets you setup new `football.db`s in minutes.

For example, to setup a football.db for the World Cup 2014 use:

`./Datafile`:

    world 'openmundi/world.db', setup: 'countries'

    football 'openfootball/national-teams'
    football 'openfootball/world-cup', setup: '2014'


Now run

    $ sportdb build


The new build command will look for the `./Datafile` script in your working folder and

- Step 1) Download all datasets as zip archives (from GitHub) to `./tmp`
- Step 2) Create all database tables
- Step 3) Read/import all datasets from the zip archives in `./tmp` (no need to unpack)

That's it.
